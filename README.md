This project solves a Delivery Route Optimization problem using Linear Programming, modeled as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The goal is to determine the most efficient path to deliver packages to multiple locations while minimizing the total travel distance and returning to the starting point (warehouse).

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
-Start from a central warehouse
-Visit 5 delivery locations exactly once
-Return to the warehouse
-Minimize total distance traveled

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
-Python 3
-PuLP â€“ Linear programming optimization library
-NumPy â€“ Data handling
-Matplotlib â€“ Visualization of the optimized route

ðŸ§  Methodology
Model Type: Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
Decision Variables: Binary variables x[i][j] indicate whether the route goes from location i to j
Objective Function: Minimize the total distance traveled

Constraints:

Each delivery point is visited exactly once
Return to the warehouse
Subtour elimination using Millerâ€“Tuckerâ€“Zemlin (MTZ) constraints
